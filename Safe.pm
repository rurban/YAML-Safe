=head1 Description

This module is a re-factoring of L<YAML::XS>, the old Perl XS binding
to C<libyaml> which offers Perl somewhat acceptable YAML support to
date.  YAML::XS never produced code which could be read from YAML, and
thus was unsuitable to be used as YAML replacement for core and CPAN.
It also required reading and setting options from global variables.

Kirill Siminov's C<libyaml> is a YAML library implementation. The
C library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification, and
offers YAML 1.2 support. It was originally bound to Python and was
later bound to Ruby.  C<libsyck> is written a bit more elegant, has
less bugs, is not as strict as libyaml, but misses some YAML
features. It can only do YAML 1.0.

This module exports the functions C<Dump> and C<Load>, and do work as
functions exactly like L<YAML::XS> and C<YAML.pm>'s corresponding
functions.  It is however preferred to use the new OO-interface to
store all options in the new created object. YAML::Safe does not
support the old globals anymore.

There are also new Safe variants of Load and Dump methods, and
options as setter methods.
With the Safe methods you can enforce loading YAML 1.0 files only,
all unsafe tags are removed. By default all blessed data is unsafe.

If you set the option C<noindentmap>, C<YAML::Safe> will behave like
with version E<lt> 0.70, which creates yml files which cannot be read
by C<YAML.pm>

However the loader is stricter than C<YAML>, C<YAML::Syck> and
C<CPAN::Meta::YAML> i.e. C<YAML::Tiny> as used in core. Set the option
C<nonstrict> to allow certain reader errors to pass the
C<CPAN::Meta> validation testsuite.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new "classname", option => value, ...

Create a YAML loader or dumper object with some options.

=item SafeClass "classname", ...

Register a string or list of strings to the list of allowed classes to
the C<Safe{Load,Dump}> methods. Without any SafeClass added, no custom
C<!> classes are allow in the YAML.  Regexp are not supported.

=item SafeLoad

=item SafeLoadFile

Restrict the loader to the registered safe classes only
or tags starting with "perl/".

=item SafeDump

=item SafeDumpFile

Restrict the dumper to the registered safe classes only
or tags starting with "perl/".

=back

And all the loader and dumper options as getter and setter methods.
See below.

=head1 Configuration

=head2 Options for Loader and Dumper

via getter and setter methods.

=over

=item C<enablecode>
=item C<get_enablecode>

If enabled turns on handling of code blocks for the loader and dumper.
It sets both the C<loadcode> and C<dumpcode> option.

=item C<disableblessed>
=item C<get_disableblessed>

Default 0

If set, i.e. blessed is disabled, all blessed data for the Loader and
Dumper is unblessed.  This is similar to the Safe methods without any
SafeClass set.

=item C<encoding>
=item C<get_encoding>

Default "utf8"

Set to "any", "utf8", "utf16le" or "utf16be".

=item C<boolean>
=item C<get_boolean>

Set to "JSON::PP" or "boolean" to enable or 0 to disable.  Encodes
true and false to the respective classes. It will try to load
L<JSON::PP> or L<boolean> and die if it can't be loaded.

With that it's possible to add new "real" booleans to a data structure:

      my $o = YAML::Safe->new->boolean("JSON::PP"); # or "boolean"
      my $data = $o->Load("booltrue: true");
      $data->{boolfalse} = JSON::PP::false;
      my $yaml = Dump($data);
      # boolfalse: false
      # booltrue: true

Please note that JSON::PP::Boolean and boolean.pm behave a bit differently.
Ideally you should only use them in boolean context.
Setting a boolean() class is only possible on a perl since v5.8.9. It will die
on older perls.

If not set, booleans are loaded as special perl variables C<PL_sv_yes> and
C<PL_sv_no>, which have the disadvantage that they are readonly, and you can't
add those to an existing data structure with pure perl.

If you simply need to load "perl booleans" that are true or false in boolean
context, you will be fine with the default setting.

=item C<safemode>
=item C<get_safemode>

Default 0

If enabled by using the the Safe methods restrict the blessing only for
the set of registered classes or tags starting with "perl/".

=back

=head2 Loader Options

via getter and setter methods.

=over

=item C<nonstrict>
=item C<get_nonstrict>

If enabled permits certain reader errors to loosely match other YAML
module semantics. In detail: Allow B<"control characters are not
allowed"> with while parsing a quoted scalar found unknown escape
character. Note that any error is stored and returned, just not
immediately. This is needed for cpan distroprefs.

However the reader error B<"invalid trailing UTF-8 octet"> and all
other utf8 strictness violations are still fatal.

And if the structure of the YAML document cannot be parsed, i.e. a
required value consists only of invalid control characters, the loader
returns an error, unlike with non-strict YAML modules.

=item C<loadcode>
=item C<get_loadcode>

Turns on deparsing and evaling of code blocks in the loader.

=back

=head2 Dumper Options

via globals variables or as optional getter and setter methods.

=over

=item C<dumpcode>
=item C<get_dumpcode>

If enabled supports Dump of CV code blocks via
C<YAML::Safe::coderef2text()>.

=item C<quotenum>
=item C<get_quotenum>

Default: enabled.

If enabled strings that look like numbers but have not
been numified will be quoted when dumping.
This ensures leading that things like leading zeros and other
formatting are preserved.

=item C<noindentmap>
=item C<get_noindentmap>

If enabled fallback to the old C<YAML::Safe> behavior to omit the
indentation of map keys, which arguably violates the first YAML spec
(L<https://yaml.org/spec/1.0/#id2566128>), is different to most other
YAML libraries and causes older C<YAML.pm> to fail.

Disabled

     authors:
       - this author

Enabled

     authors:
     - this author

=item C<indent>
=item C<get_indent>

Default 2.
Valid values are from 1 - 10.

=item C<wrapwidth>
=item C<get_wrapwidth>

Default 80

Control text wrapping.

=item C<canonical>
=item C<get_canonical>

Default: disabled.

Enable to sort map keys.

=item C<unicode>
=item C<get_unicode>

Default 1

Set to undef or 0 to disallow unescaped non-ASCII characters.
e.g. C<YAML::Safe->new->unicode(0)>

=item C<linebreak>
=item C<get_linebreak>

Default ln

Set to "any", "cr", "ln" or "crln".

=item C<openended>
=item C<get_openended>

Default 0

If enabled embed the yaml into "...", if an explicit
document end is required.

=back

=head1 Using YAML::Safe with Unicode

Handling unicode properly in Perl can be a pain. YAML::Safe only deals
with streams of utf8 octets. Just remember this:

    $perl = Load($utf8_octets);
    $utf8_octets = Dump($perl);

There are many, many places where things can go wrong with unicode. If
you are having problems, use Devel::Peek on all the possible data
points.
